This folder contains two approaches for the 5th task, one based on fully connected Quantum Neural Networks,and the other one based on Quanvolutional Neural Network.
The task was to implement this [paper](!https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1526612519302245) . It is based on classifying the images as defective or non defective, but here I used a Quantum Machine Learning Model for the task. For this task, a real world dataset was used.
