# QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production


For the this task([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/tree/main/Conspicuity%20Detection)), I approached the problem with two techniques, Quantum Neural Networks and Quanvolutional Neural Networks, and evaluated their results based on their respective F1 scores. For the QNN, I reduced image dimensionality using PCA and implemented a hybrid model combining classical and quantum layers. For the second method, I applied a Quanvolutional layer on the images, and then passed them as input to a classical model. These results were compared to the passing just the images as it is to the same model, that is without quantum pre-processing.
