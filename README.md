### Project Solution:
In this project, I tackled 5 tasks. The first task([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Task1.docx)), was just getting acquainted with Pennylane as a platform. The second([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Parity%20and%20Iris%20classification(Task%202).ipynb)) introduced Variational classifiers, and this was used to fit a parity function, and classify Iris dataset Images. For these, tasks I modified the optimizers, and the circuits to achieve the required accuracy in fewer steps, and get the function to converge quickly. 

For the 3rd task([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/MNIST%20using%20Quonvolution(Task3).ipynb)), I used the technique of Quanvolutional Neural Networks, to classify the MNIST data images. To further compare results, I made a custom ResNet-Type architecture on the top of quanvoluted images, to leverage the benfits of classical computing. 

For the 4th task([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/blob/main/Fitting%20a%20sine%20wave(Task%204).ipynb)), I designed a single qubit circuit made up of single qubit rotation gates to fit the parameters, in order to simulate the sine function. The MSE found on a tes dataset was 0.00.

For the 5th task([link](https://github.com/Nb4159/QML-for-Conspicuity-Detection-in-Production/tree/main/Conspicuity%20Detection)), I approached the problem with two techniques, Quantum Neural Networks and Quanvolutional Neural Networks, and evaluated their results based on their respective F1 scores. For the QNN, I reduced image dimensionality using PCA and implemented a hybrid model combining classical and quantum layers. For the second method, I applied a Quanvolutional layer on the images, and then passed them as input to a classical model. These results were compared to the passing just the images as it is to the same model, that is without quantum pre-processing.
